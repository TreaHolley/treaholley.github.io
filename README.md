            <summary>Hello World</summary>
                <p>This was completed through the typescript download to confirm that it was downloaded and works correctly. From this I learned Typescript has the ability to create a javascript file to print a string of words to the console. Used the command below in typescript which converted the same command to javascript to print "Hello, World!"</p>

            <summary>Stylesity Webpage</summary>
            <p>I started to develop a website and built the main framework of it. I have a navbar that I could attach pages to. I fixed the carousel to work so now it can move on its own or when you click the button. I ran into sizing issues with the carosel and am working on a fix. The carousel uses bootstrap along with some javascript. I have a responsive nav that I am working on but the drop down css is not working so I may rework my code into something slightly new to get it to work. The dropdown is not working due to me not using the bootstrap verson so the language is clashing. I want to build this into a full fledged webpage so I haven't moved into other projects yet since there is still a lot for me to learn here. See live website here: https://treaholley.github.io/Clothing-Webpage/. Find the code to website: https://github.com/TreaHolley/Clothing-Webpage.</p>

# REVIEWS

I will be doing reviews on tutorial documents stating what I learned, what could have been better and would I recommend it.

* Flexbot Froggy was a really good interactive tool to learn css. I believe the best way to learn is by doing and this webpage gives a great way to practice while learning about styling using css. I believe they should add more problems to the webpage since the training is a little short but I definently would recommend. Find tutorial [here](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
